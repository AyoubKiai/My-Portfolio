I'm Ayoub Kiai from Rennes, France. I did my degree in Accounting and Business analysis at Audencia Nantes. Ambitious and a passionate learner, I continously challenge myself to develop and reach new goals. I am passionate about Data Science. I think it's intellectually stimulating and I like using cutting-edge methods and technologies to solve a problem. So I never get bored because there is always something new to discover and lear. Apart form that, I love litterature and walking.
